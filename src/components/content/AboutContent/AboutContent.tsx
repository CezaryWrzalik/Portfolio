        Iâ€™ve started my adventure with programming in 2018 by making my first
        bank app in Python and MySQL but quickly after that i switched into Html
        and JavaScript. For over 2 years i was learning this language by writing
        all kind of applications like games, weather apps forums or shops and
        implementing new technologies into them.
