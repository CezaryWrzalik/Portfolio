          Iâ€™ve started my adventure with programming in 2018 by making my first
          bank app in Python and MySQL but quickly after that i switched into
          Html and JavaScript. For over 2 years i was learning this language by
          writing all kind of applications like games, weather apps forums or
          shops and implementing new technologies into them.
